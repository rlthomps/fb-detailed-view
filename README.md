How many hours did it take to complete?

I think I spent 8 hours on this

Which required and optional stories have you completed?

Add a container view and modify properties: backgroundColor, cornerRadius, font, textColor, shadowOffset.
Add buttons with different images for default and highlighted.
Add UIImageViews and choose the right mode: aspect fill, aspect fit, etc.
Add a UITextField with a background image.
Add UILabels with attributed text (instead of plain text), so that you can bold individual words.
Setup CocoaPods for managing 3rd party libraries and use TTTAttributedLabel to style the link and make it clickable
Optional: The like button should toggle the "liked" state.
Optional: Move the textfield when the keyboard appears.
Optional: The left and right navigation buttons should be real buttons. In other words, when you tap on them, they should have a highlight state. The buttons don't do anything when you tap on them.
